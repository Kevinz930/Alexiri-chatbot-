# Conversational Chatbot

This project compares the efficacy of two models of a general conversational chatbot. The first generative model is trained on the Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus using a recurrent neural network in PyTorch. The second model is a simpler retrieval-based chatbot that classifies the user's intent into a predefined list of intents and fetches an appropriate response.
